Cheese is one of the oldest foods we humans have  produced, possibly dating from the beginning of sheep and cattle herding êé,ééé years  ago. That said, the discovery of cheese making was probably accidental.

However, the earliest archaeological evidence of cheese making  dates back to ð,ðéé-ò,ééé years ago in Mongolia where residues of cheese making  products were found in ceramics pots1.  Cheese was a staple food in both Classical Greece and Rome, although it is not clear  that the either civilization was responsible for expanding awareness of cheese, as most',\n 'that the either civilization was responsible for expanding awareness of cheese, as most  places they traded or conquered were already making cheese in some manner or another.  Nevertheless, it was in Europe, more than elsewhere, that cheese became so wildly  diverse both in production methods and the final product. Cheese was a staple product  throughout the Middle Ages, and such were the differences in European cheeses that in  êíðð a Savoyard polymath named Pantaleone da Cofienza published a book, Summa  Lacticiniorum (“A Compendium of Milk Products”), that was devoted almost entirely to  a discussion of European cheeses [1].  As Cofienza was aware, cheese is most commonly made from cow, sheep, goat, and',\n \"a discussion of European cheeses [1].  As Cofienza was aware, cheese is most commonly made from cow, sheep, goat, and  water buffalo milk, although other types of milk, such as mare’s milk, reindeer milk,  and camel milk, are also used. Cheese styles, textures, and flavors depend on the origin  of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether the milk has been pasteurized, the  amount of milkfat, bacteria and mold, processing, and aging. Sometimes herbs, spices, or  wood smoke are used for flavoring, and other cheeses are internally or externally flavored  with chives, garlic, or fruit. Cheese ranges in color from off-white and pale yellow (most  common), to light-brown or dark-brown, to full of blue or green veins, to orange. Orange\",\n 'common), to light-brown or dark-brown, to full of blue or green veins, to orange. Orange  color does not occur naturally in cheese, but is generally created by adding annatto, an  orange-red dye made from the nuts of the achiote tree. This was originally done to make  winter milk or industrially produced cheese look richer in flavor, but it soon became  standard practice for some types of cheese such as Red Leicester, a mild and crumbly  English cheese, and Mimolette, a hard and slightly nutty cheese from the north of France.  In the United States, orange colored cheese, whatever the name, is especially popular.

Fermentology • Book  A Brief History of Cheese [Essay]  3  What da Cofienza did not say but seems to have intuited, is that cheese is a nutritional  super food because it concentrates most of the nourishment of the milk, and makes the  milk last much longer. The solids extracted from the milk in order to make cheese contain  almost all of the milk fat (assuming the milk has not been skimmed) and fat-soluble  vitamins, most of the proteins, and some of the minerals.

Whey can be drunk as a beverage, dried to make protein powder,  or cooked and concentrated to make whey cheeses, such as Ricotta, which is light  textured, creamy, and slightly sweet. Most whey, however, is simply discarded.  Historically, soft cheeses were made for relatively quick consumption and thus eaten in or  near the area where they were made, whereas harder cheeses were aged for many  months, and could be exported great distances. Since the mid-nineteenth century and the  invention of refrigerated transport, soft and semi-soft-cheeses can be exported to all parts',\n 'invention of refrigerated transport, soft and semi-soft-cheeses can be exported to all parts  of the globe, although they should still be eaten sooner than hard cheeses, as they are  likely to be invaded by other bacteria (i.e. to rot) long before hard cheeses are. Put  another way, your cheese is always alive, but you don’t necessarily want it be alive in  all ways.  ~~~  In order to learn more about specific cheeses that you might find in the store, it’s  helpful to understand how cheese is made. All cheese making begins by “ripening” the  milk, that is, by causing lactobacillales (lactic acid bacteria) to sour the milk. This is why  cheese is a fermented food, and it is these bacteria that begin to give cheese its particular',\n 'cheese is a fermented food, and it is these bacteria that begin to give cheese its particular  flavors. In early cheese making, the bacteria were probably left to chance. For most  modern cheese, however, bacterial cultures are added by the cheese-maker. These  bacterial cultures produce not only lactic acid, which gives cheese its sharp taste, but also  diacetyl, which has a buttery taste. Some cheeses such as Emmentaler (a.k.a. “Swiss  Cheese”) also use propionic bacteria, which consume lactic acid and produce a round,  almost hazel-nut taste, as well as carbon dioxide bubbles. It is these bubbles that give  Emmental its characteristic holes.  During cheese making, the milk is always kept warm or even slightly heated in order to',\n 'Emmental its characteristic holes.  During cheese making, the milk is always kept warm or even slightly heated in order to  encourage bacterial growth. This can be done by adding hot water to the curd, or by  heating the walls or “jacket” of the cheese vat with hot water. Once the milk has soured,  the next step is to separate the curd (milk solids) from the whey (mostly water).  “Curdling” is usually done by adding rennet to the soured milk. Rennet is loaded with  enzymes and is traditionally extracted from the fourth stomach of an unweaned calf.

Some cheeses such as Pecorino  Romano, a hard, salty, tangy, ewe’s milk cheese are always curdled with lamb’s  rennet, others are curdled with vinegar or even lemon juice. But whatever is used to  curdle the milk, the proteins in the milk coagulate and shrink, trapping the fat globules  and forcing out more of the watery whey. Once the rennet has been carefully stirred into  the milk, the curd is allowed to set, that is, to form a moist gel.',\n 'the milk, the curd is allowed to set, that is, to form a moist gel.  It’s at this point that the difference between hard and soft cheeses begins to occur. For  most soft cheeses, the set curd is simply scooped out with a perforated ladle, and placed  into a perforated mold or form (which gives us the Italian word formaggio and the French  words fromage). This allows the curd to continue to drain off whey by gravity alone. For  fresh goat’s milk cheeses that’s pretty much the entire process, but for two of my  favorite soft cheeses, Camembert and Brie de Meaux, the curd is poured into shallow,  round molds and then sprayed with the other kind of mold (i.e. a fungus), in this case',\n 'round molds and then sprayed with the other kind of mold (i.e. a fungus), in this case  Penicillium candidum, which promotes the growth of an edible, off-white rind. Thus,  Camembert and Brie begin as insipid, semi-soft cheeses, but as they age the proteolytic  enzymes released by the mold break down the protein chains in the cheese, producing an  ever-creamier, and ultimately almost liquid cheese, with a strong odor but mild taste.  However, to make a harder cheeses the set curd is cut with a multiple-bladed “breaker”  to promote more whey extraction. Once the curd has been cut it is allowed to set a second  time, but this time it is firmer, almost rubbery. Having reset, the cut curd is often',\n 'time, but this time it is firmer, almost rubbery. Having reset, the cut curd is often  “cooked” (i.e. heated to a higher temperature, usually around íé c. or êéî f., and never  hotter than ïé c. or êíé f.), which promotes greater whey expulsion and creates a  smoother and more even-textured end product. Some of the bacteria are killed in the  cooking process, but hardly all, so that even a “cooked” cheese remains very much alive  with micro-organisms.  Cutting and then cooking the curd helps to create protein and fat globules, now curds  (plural), anywhere from pea to walnut size, from which still more whey is drained off.

In the case of Cheddar, the world’s most popular cheese—although it varies greatly in  quality, texture and taste—the loaves of curd are sliced into ì cm. (ê.î-ë inch) thick slabs  the size of notebook paper, which are then stacked four to eight high, and turned over  ever ten minutes or so for roughly an hour.

As with other hard cheeses, these “grains” are salted, stirred, and then put into a  mold and compressed. Of course many readers will note that much American cheddar is  actually a fairly mild, moist cheese, and this is because the curd is rinsed and not cut so  fine, thus reducing acidity and allowing for greater moisture retention.

It has nothing like  the sharpness or earthy flavor and slightly crumbly texture of high-quality cheddar.  For most cheeses, salt is added to the cut curd both for reasons of taste and preservation.  Of course too much salt would kill all the bacteria in a cheese, but a judicious amount  slows down bacterial growth and allows the cheese to age without rotting. And whether  salted or not, the cut curds are now put into the molds that determine their final shape.  Since there is still some whey in the curd, most molds allow for drainage while the curds  are being pressed. For example, Manchego, a slightly tangy, hard sheep’s milk cheese',\n 'are being pressed. For example, Manchego, a slightly tangy, hard sheep’s milk cheese  from Spain, was traditionally pressed in molds made of plaited straw, which left a  distinctive pattern on the outside of the cheese. Today, that same pattern is created by  metal molds.  Once a cheese is hard enough to be removed from its form, it is salted if it has not already  been so. In fact, a “pickled” cheese like Feta, made from sheep’s milk, is removed  from its mold and aged in a brine made of salt water and whey up to the point of  consumption, while mozzarella curd is stretched by hand or machine during the cooking  process, formed into balls, and then placed in a very mild brine.

Broadly speaking, a warmer environment speeds cheese ripening, whereas a cooler  environment slows it down. Likewise, a relatively dry environment is necessary for  cheeses to harden properly, so that cheeses destined for long ageing such as Parmesano-  Reggiano, which is both salty, sweet, and nutty all at once, need a relatively dry and cool  environment. A moist environment is better for soft cheeses as it prevents desiccation  and promotes the growth of desired molds.

Semi-soft cheeses such as Limburger,  Munster, and Époisse, are surface ripened with bacteria, which give them their famously  smelly odors, although the inside of these cheeses is generally mild. Some other cheeses  are covered in leaves, ash, or soot, or washed in alcohol as a way to slow or prevent  surface bacterial growth and impart subtle flavors. Emmental receives no surface  treatment at all other than being cleaned and waxed. Lastly, blue cheeses are inoculated  with a culture of blue mold, either at the forming stage, as with Roquefort from France, or  once the cheese has been formed, as with Stilton from England, Cashel Blue from Ireland,',\n 'once the cheese has been formed, as with Stilton from England, Cashel Blue from Ireland,  and Maytag Blue from Iowa.

This very brief survey of how most cheeses are made has focused upon the cheeses you  are most likely to find in the store, but be aware that the number of artisanal cheese-  makers in America is growing by the year, and many stores are increasing the number of  foreign cheeses they sell as well.

When you do purchase a cheese, my advice is to rescue it from the  ignominy of cellophane, if that’s what it came in, and store it in wax paper, or else leave  it unwrapped but put it in a Tupperware container in the refrigerator.

Cheese is one of the oldest foods we humans have  produced, possibly dating from the beginning of sheep and cattle herding êé,ééé years  ago. That said, the discovery of cheese making was probably accidental. It’s likely that  the curdling action of rennet was discovered when a herdsman poured milk into a sack or  pouch made of an animal’s stomach, and this may have happened independently in\n"

Certain readers extrapolated from this that  pizza’s allegedly addictive quality came from casomorphins, the tiny protein crystals  that result from the breakdown of casein, the primary protein of milkfat. True,  casomorphins can activate the human opioid system, just as drugs like morphine do, but  the degree is negligible and in most cases of cheese eating doesn’t occur at all. More  importantly, our brain registers with delight when it senses protein, fat, and salt, which  most cheeses contain to some degree. But the real reason for pizza’s position atop the  “craveability” index is the combination of carbohydrates and sugar (in the dough and\n",
      "Chunk 26 text/reference: “craveability” index is the combination of carbohydrates and sugar (in the dough and  tomato sauce). In other words, pizza has a massive glycemic load, and causes our blood  sugar to spike. We humans like that. But fear not, there is nothing addictive about cheese.
